     * the unlock, and it goes through no WorkManager, whose database does. Every other method keeps
     * waiting for the unlock, which [UserUnlockedStarter] is registered for. The start is asked for
     * through [ShizukuReceiverStarter] like any other, so that it is one start at a time and shows
     * up in the log as a request with a reason.

     * The watchdog is not started here: it is not direct-boot aware, so the platform cannot find it
     * before the unlock. [UserUnlockedStarter] starts it then, and the alarm backstop below is the
     * one thing of the watchdog's that can be armed now.
